<!-- 
  Note: font-weight property could be set to:
  - normal or bold.
  - values between 100 and 900, in which normal is 400 and bold is 700.
  - bolder or lighter, which is relative to the parent element's font weight. 
    Lighter is 100 less than the parent element's font weight and bolder is 100 more than the parent element's 
    font weight.

  Note: text-align property could be set to:
  - left, right, center, or justify.
  - You can also use start or end, which is relative to the direction of the text. This means that if the text 
    is written from left to right, start is left and end is right. If the text is written from right to left, 
    start is right and end is left.
